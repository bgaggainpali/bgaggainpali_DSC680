# Project 1: Loan Approval Prediction Process
In financial industry, deciding on a loan application, whether to approve or not is a two-edged sword.  Bank should not lose business by denying a legitimate customer, who can repay.  Also, it should not approve loan to in-eligible customer.  Banks are playing important role in challenging times like now, with COVID pandemic across the globe.
With the enhancement in the banking sector lots of people are applying for bank loans but the bank has its limited assets which it has to grant to limited people only, so finding out to whom the loan can be granted which will be a safer option for the bank is a typical process. In this paper we try to predict the customer, whether he is eligible for the loan approval and to reduce this risk factor of bank efforts and assets.


# Project 2: Credit Card Default Prediction

In financial industry, banks are playing important role in challenging times like now, with COVID pandemic across the globe. People are losing jobs and financial institutions are facing more delinquency rate on credit card loans.  The increase in delinquency rate will result in significant financial loss to commercial banks.  It is very critical for lending institutions like banks to have a prediction model to be able to predict customers for credit card default. 
I have selected the topic, as I was interested in knowing the variables which influence the credit card default key factors. As I explore more about the domain, I understand that itâ€™s not same set of rules which is being used across domain and each different banks and credit unions are based on different credit score calculation structure when approving credit cards, but the factors which influence the default are same.


# Project 3: Predicting Churn for Bank Customers 
In financial industry, banks are playing important role in challenging times like now, with COVID pandemic across the globe. People are losing jobs and financial institutions are facing more Customer churn in Bank Accounts.  The increase in Customer Churn rate will result in significant financial loss to commercial banks.  It is very critical for lending institutions like banks to have a prediction model to be able to predict customers churn to better serve the customers and reduce the churn.
We could see many people close their bank accounts where they cannot maintain minimum balance in the account with the current pandemic Covid situation and it would impact financial budgeting for banks as it has limited assets which can handle the churn until certain extent only, so finding out the customers who are possibly to fall in the churn category will help banks to mitigate and balance the risk of the churn customers. In this paper I will try to predict to find, who are possibly to fall in as churn category and identify the customers to reduce this risk factor of bank to better serve the customers.
